# starlink-toolkit

A collection of configs, scripts, and notes for getting the most out of Starlink in nomadic/off-grid setups.

This repo will cover:
- Performance monitoring
- Power optimizations
- Network tweaks
- Mounting and portability solutions

Early-stage and experimental. Built as I test in real-world conditions.
